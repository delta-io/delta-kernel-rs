## Known issue handling

Do not report a defect already described by a nearby source `TODO` or `FIXME` with a concrete
issue reference, such as `TODO(#3297): ...` or a full GitHub issue URL. Suppress only the same
defect, not other nearby problems. Report a TODO or FIXME added or modified by the PR when it
lacks an issue reference; treat it as non-blocking unless the incomplete behavior is blocking.
PR descriptions and review history do not count. This does not excuse executable `todo!()` or
`unimplemented!()`.
