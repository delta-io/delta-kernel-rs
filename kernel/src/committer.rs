//! The `committer` module provides a [`Committer`] trait which allows different implementations to
//! define how to commit transactions to a catalog. This is only applicable to catalog-managed
//! tables. For non-catalog-managed tables, the kernel commits directly to the object-store (via
//! put-if-absent call to storage to atomically write new commit files).
//!
//! By implementing this trait, different catalogs can define what happens when the kernel needs to
//! commit a transaction to a table. The goal terminal state of every [`Transaction`] is to be
//! committed to the table. This means writing the changes (we call these actions) in the
//! transaction as a new version of the table. The [`Committer`] trait exposes a single method,
//! [`commit`] which takes an engine, an iterator of actions (as [`EngineData`] batches), and
//! [`CommitMetadata`] (which includes critical commit metadata like the version to commit) to
//! allow different catalogs to define what it means to 'commit' the actions to a table. For some,
//! this may mean writing staged commits to object storage and retaining an in-memory list (server
//! side) of commits. For others, this may mean writing new (version, actions) tuples to a
//! database.
//!
//! The implementation of [`commit`] must ensure that the actions are committed atomically to the
//! table at the given version and either (1) persisted directly to object storage as published
//! deltas as in non-catalog-managed tables or (2) persisted within the catalog and made available
//! to readers during snapshot contstruction via the [`log_tail`] API.
//!
