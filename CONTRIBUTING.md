# How to contribute to Delta Kernel Rust

Welcome! Weâ€™d love to have you contribute to Delta Kernel Rust!

## Did you find a bug?

Create an issue with a reproducible example. Please specify the Rust version, delta-kernel-rs version, the code executed, and the error message.

## Did you create a PR to fix a bug?

Open a pull request and add "Fixes #issue_number" in the PR description.

We appreciate bug fixes - thank you in advance!

## Would you like to add a new feature or change existing code?

**Letâ€™s chat first!**  
If you would like to add a feature or change existing behavior, please create an issue describing your idea. The core team will help discuss the design, explore alternatives, and align on the direction before any code is written.

For **substantial features or major changes**, we may ask you to draft a brief design proposal (an RFC) before implementation starts. This helps us:

- Avoid duplicate or misaligned work
- Explore the design space together
- Document key decisions for the future
- Build a shared understanding in the community

Donâ€™t worryâ€”RFCs donâ€™t need to be formal or long! Just outline the motivation, your approach, and any alternatives you considered. Weâ€™ll guide you through the process.

ðŸ‘‰ **WIP: See our [RFC template](../protocol_rfcs/000-template.md) for guidance.**

For **small enhancements and bug fixes**, feel free to open a PR directly (but opening an issue first is always welcome if youâ€™re unsure).

## Do you have questions about the source code?

Feel free to create an issue or join the [Delta Lake Slack](https://go.delta.io/slack) with questions! We chat in the `#delta-kernel` channel.

Thanks for reading! :heart: :crab:

**Summary of our contribution process:**
- **Bugs and small fixes:** PRs welcome!
- **New features/major changes:** Start with an issue and discussion. For bigger ideas, weâ€™ll work together on a lightweight RFC before coding.
- **Questions?** Issues and Slack are open to all.

Weâ€™re excited to build Delta Kernel Rust together!
